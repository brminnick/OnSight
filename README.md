# OnSight
This is an iOS, Android, and UWP app created using Xamarin.Forms.

OnSight was created to help field technician inspect crops. It allows the technician to take notes and photos during their field inspection.

This app utilizes an MVVM Architecture and incorporates a local SQLite Database. It also uses the Computer Vision API hosted by Microsoft Cognitive Services to ensure the photo is a valid photo of plants.
